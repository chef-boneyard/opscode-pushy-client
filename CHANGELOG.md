# Chef Push Client Changes

## 1.0.1 - 2014-04-09

* Add require with rescue for chef/config_fetcher needed for compatibility with
  Chef >= 11.8.0.

* Add signal handling for the client. The client now does a graceful
  shutdown when it receives a `TERM`, `QUIT`, or `KILL` signal. The
  client will reconfigure itself if sent `USR1`. This improves the
  compatibility of the push client to be managed under runit which
  sends signals for restart.

* Add Apache 2 license and headers in preparation for open sourcing.

* Unify gem and repo tag versioning scheme.
